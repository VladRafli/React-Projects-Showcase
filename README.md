# React-Projects-Showcase

A React framework based website to train my skills in:

- Front-end (React, Socket.io-client, Axios)
- Back-end (Express, Socket.io, Sequelize, Tedious)
- Database (MSSQL)

Things implemented here:

- Client checking if Server is up or down (On route '/' with Socket.io)
- Number of Projects that I do (On route '/')

Nothing special here, just I trying making something. But, if interested in some code implementation, you can contact me. Thank you!
